<p>Qingkai is involved in the following courses:</p>

<ul>
	<li type="ready"><a href="/Compilers.html">Compilers</a> (2024 Spring,
	2025 Spring)
		<p>Compilers are the backbone of modern software development, translating
		human-readable code into machine-executable instructions. Whether you're a
		beginner or an experienced developer looking to deepen your understanding, this
		course will equip you with the knowledge and skills of designing, implementing,
		and optimizing compilers. Throughout this journey, we'll cover various topics,
		including lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic analysis, code generation,
		and optimization techniques. You'll learn about compiler architectures, compiler
		construction tools, and practical strategies for building efficient compilers
		for various programming languages.</p>
	</li>

	<li type="ready"><a href="/Interpreters.html">Interpreters and Virtual Machines</a>
	(2025 Spring)
		<p>This course delves into the fascinating world of how programs are executed in
		another way, focusing on interpreted execution rather than compiled execution.
		An interpreter or VM creates a simulated environment in which programs can run,
		providing benefits like platform independence and enhanced security. This course
		includes popular architectures like the tree-walk interpreter and Java Virtual
		Machine (JVM). By the end of the course, students will not only have a deep
		understanding of how interpreters and VMs function, but also will have their own
		controllable programming language, MiniJava. This knowledge is essential for
		anyone interested in the inner workings of programming languages or computer
		architecture.</p>
	</li>

	<li type="ready"><a href="/Data_Structure.html">Data Structure and Algorithms</a>
	(2025 Fall)
		<p>This course provides the essential foundation for writing efficient and
		scalable software. It focuses on organizing, storing, and processing data in
		ways that optimize performance and resource usage. The course explores core data
		structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, before
		progressing to more advanced topics like trees, graphs, and hash tables.
		Alongside these structures, students learn key algorithms for searching,
		sorting, recursion, dynamic programming, and graph traversal. Mastery of data
		structures and related algorithms is crucial for software development,
		competitive programming, and technical interviews, making this course
		indispensable for aspiring programmers and computer scientists.</p>

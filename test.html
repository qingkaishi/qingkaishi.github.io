Qingkai Shi is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the department of computer
science at Purdue University. His major research interests focus on the use of
compiler techniques, especially static analysis, to rigorously ensure software
security. He has published extensively at premium venues of programming
languages (PLDI, OOPSLA), software engineering (ICSE, FSE), and cybersecurity
(S&amp;P). His research received many awards including ACM SIGPLAN Distinguished
Paper Award, ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award, and Hong Kong Ph.D.
Fellowship. His research has led to the discovery of hundreds of zero-day
software vulnerabilities in open-source software and has been successfully
commercialized in Sourcebrella Inc, a static analysis tool vendor. Qingkai
obtained his B.S. and Ph.D. from Nanjing University and the Hong Kong University
of Science and Technology, respectively.</p>

<ul style="margin-right: 5mm">
	<li>Static Analysis for Reverse Engineering
		<p>I am currently working on reverse engineering, which attempts to understand
		through logical reasoning how a previously made software accomplishes a task
		with very little insight into exactly how it does so. We reverse engineer, or
		disassemble, binary code into assembly code (<a
		href="/public_pdfs/SP23DARM.pdf">S&amp;P'23</a>); we reverse engineer software
		implementations to obtain the specification of input formats and state machines.
		We expect to use these techniques to facilitate automated security analysis such
		as vulnerability scanning and fuzz testing. To date, we have discovered <a
		href="/Reverse_Engineering.html">many zero-day vulnerabilities</a> through these
		techniques.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Static Analysis for Vulnerability Scanning
		<p>Pinpoint is an industrial-strength automated software vulnerability scanner.
		It has found <a href="/catapult.html">hundreds of bugs</a>, including <a
		href="/CVE.html">many CVEs</a>, in mature systems. It has been successfully
		commercialized at <a href="http://www.sourcebrella.com">Sourcebrella Inc</a>
		(acquired by <a href="https://www.antgroup.com/en">Ant Group</a> in 2020) and
		deployed in daily operations for improving the quality of <a
		href="https://global.alipay.com/platform/site/ihome">Alipay</a>, a popular
		digital payment app with over a billion monthly active users. Interested readers
		can refer to my <a href="/public_pdfs/thesis.pdf">Ph.D. dissertation</a> as well
		as works on general value-flow analysis (<a
		href="/public_pdfs/PLDI2018.pdf">PLDI'18</a>, <a
		href="/public_pdfs/ICSE2020a.pdf">ICSE'20a</a>, <a
		href="/public_pdfs/ICSE2020b.pdf">ICSE'20b</a>, <a
		href="/public_pdfs/OOPSLA22-FLARE.pdf">OOPSLA'22a</a>, <a
		href="/public_pdfs/TOSEM23.pdf">TOSEM'23</a>) and detecting specific bug types
		(<a href="/public_pdfs/ICSE2019.pdf">ICSE'19</a><a
		href="images/sigsoft.png"><img src="images/award.gif" style="height:1em" /></a>,

		<a href="/public_pdfs/FSE22.pdf">ESEC/FSE'22</a>).</p>
	</li>

	<li>Static Analysis for Fuzz Testing
		<p>Fuzz testing is powerful for revealing coding errors and security loopholes
		in software, networks, or operating systems. We are interested in leveraging
		static analysis techniques, particularly, abstract interpretation, to make fuzz
		testers incremental (<a href="/public_pdfs/SP2020.pdf">S&amp;P'20</a>) and
		directed (<a href="/public_pdfs/SP22.pdf">S&amp;P'22</a>). We also apply fuzz
		testers to domain-specific application scenarios, including testing black boxes
		with entropy (<a href="/public_pdfs/TR2016.pdf">TRel'16</a>, <a
		href="/public_pdfs/ISSTA20-DeepGini.pdf">ISSTA'20d</a>), testing multi-threading
		programs (<a href="/public_pdfs/TSE2016.pdf">TSE'16</a>), and testing SMT
		solvers (<a href="/public_pdfs/ISSTA2021.pdf">ISSTA'21</a>, <a
		href="/public_pdfs/FSE21.pdf">ESEC/FSE'21</a>). We received the Huawei
		distinguished collaborator 2021 award on deploying our S&amp;P'20 work.</p>
	</li>

	<li>Static Analysis for Theorem Proving
		<p>Automated theorem proving is an infrastructure technology for effective
		vulnerability scanning and fuzz testing. Directly employing a general-purpose
		theorem prover, e.g., the <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Z3</a>
		theorem prover, could miss a lot of optimization opportunities. We aim to
		provide dedicated theorem provers (<a
		href="/public_pdfs/ISSTA20-Trident.pdf">ISSTA'20a</a>, <a
		href="/public_pdfs/PLDI21-Fusion.pdf">PLDI'21</a>, <a
		href="/public_pdfs/OOPSLA21.pdf">OOPSLA'21</a>), particularly taking advantage
		of program semantics to make a theorem prover faster and, in turn, improve the
		vulnerability scanners and fuzz testers. We also utilze fuzz testing to ensure
		the quality of theorem provers (<a
		href="/public_pdfs/ISSTA2021.pdf">ISSTA'21</a>, <a
		href="/public_pdfs/FSE21.pdf">ESEC/FSE'21</a>) and have discovered <a
		href="https://smtfuzz.github.io/">hundreds of bugs</a> in Z3 and CVC4.</p>
